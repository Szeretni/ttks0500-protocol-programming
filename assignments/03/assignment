Make the following modifications to the server example:

    Add two command line parameters to the program:
        address
        port
    If these two values are not given from the command line the server should print an error message and exit immediately
    These two values should be used for binding the server socket with bind()
    Keep the server running after a single connection has been handled.
        You don’t have to be able to handle multiple connections at the same time!
        Once a connection has been handled the server should go back to waiting new connection (accept()-method)

Make the following modifications to the client program:

    Add two command line parameters to the program:
        address
        port
    If these two values are not given from the command line the client should print an error message and exit immediately
    Handle the exceptions from connect() and send() and print a human readable error message if an error occurs
        e.g. “cannot connect to server” or “sending data to the server failed”
