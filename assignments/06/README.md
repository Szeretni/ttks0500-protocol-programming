An example specification "Derpy File Transfer Protocol (DFTP)" given by our teacher is implemented completely.

["Files"](./05/files/) folder has some files to play around with and [exampleOutputs.md](./05/exampleOutputs.md) has examples of every 
requirement in the spec.

Example usage of the client: python client.py localhost 1234 "LIST 0 ."

Example usage of the server: python server.py localhost 1234
